# ocropus-models
Here are some of my models I created for text recognition with OCRopus https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy

## sh1890.pyrnn.gz
German book from the end of 19th century ("Ortschafts-Verzeichnis f√ºr die Provinz Schleswig-Holstein"). The complete book can be found here: http://dibiki.ub.uni-kiel.de/viewer/resolver?urn=urn:nbn:de:gbv:8:2-2750405 With the model you can achieve an error rate somewhere between 1.5% and 0.7%.
